                <strong>Accessing a group requires the following:</strong>
                <div class="flex flex-col">
                    <li><strong>Group Code</strong> – provided upon group creation (used by everyone)</li>
                    <li><strong>User ID</strong> – unique to each participant</li>
                    <li><strong>Admin ID</strong> – used only by the Admin</li>
                </div>
                <strong>If “Anyone Can Join” is enabled:</strong>
                <div class="flex flex-col">
                    <li>Participants can join by entering the Group Code</li>
                    <li>They’ll receive a User ID upon joining — this must be saved to access the group later</li>
                </div>
                <strong>If added manually by the Admin:</strong>
                <div class="flex flex-col">
                    <li>The participant won’t receive a User ID automatically</li>
                    <li>The Admin must provide the User ID directly to the participant</li>
                </div>
                <i class="text-center">Without both the Group Code and your ID, access will be denied.</i>
                <strong class="text-center">💡 Keep your User ID and Group Code safe. You’ll need both to re-access your group later!</strong>
